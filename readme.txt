Final Project Readme.

Welcome to our project! We have created a machine learning model to predict whether or not BTC price will go up or down tomorrow.

Main Files:

1) demo.py is the main program. Running it will produce an output telling you whether or not tomorrow's BTC price is predicted to go up or down.

2) wordcloud_today_news.py is a word cloud generating program. Running it will generate an image of all the words used in the sentiment analyzer that is ultimately used to predict BTC price trend. See out.png

3) main.ipnyb is the python notebook where we trained different machine learning models and compared their outputs.


Miscellaneous Files:
1) project.ipynb & create_graph.ipynb are notebooks used to generate graphs which we have included in our final report

2) poster v2.pptx is the final project presentation

3) All '.pkl' files are saved outputs of our sentiment analyzer model. This is so that we can avoid retraining the sentiment analyzer model.

4) bitcoin_df.csv is a snapshot of the dataframe we used to train our machine learning models

5) Project Proposal.pdf is the initial project proposal

6) GMT20200811-021046_Rajlakshmi_2560x1440.mp4 is a video of our project presentation

7) Bitcoin_news_sentiment.ipynb is just the sentiment analyzer model
