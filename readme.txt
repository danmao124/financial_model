Final Project Readme.

Welcome to our project! We have created a machine learning model to predict whether or not BTC price will go up or down tomorrow.

1) demo.py is the main program. Running it will produce an output telling you whether or not tomorrow's BTC price is predicted to go up or down.

2) wordcloud_today_news.py is a word cloud generating program. Running it will generate an image of all the words used in the sentiment analyzer that is ultimately used to predict BTC price trend. See out.png

3) main.ipnyb is the python notebook where we trained different machine learning models and compared their outputs.
